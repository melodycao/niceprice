# NicePrice

A tool that will help immigrants/ refugees/ low-income families to find the best price for certain products to minimize their costs. 

# IDEA DESCRIPTION

A tool that allows immigrants/ refugees/ low-income families to see where they could get certain products for the lowest price as possible. It will also display the average price of the produce so that newcomers have an idea of how much each product cost generally. It is very easy for the newcomers to pay way more than they should for certain products and not know how to minimize their costs, which is why this tool will allow the newcomers and low-income families to manage their finances more efficiently. 


# What is your envisioned solution?
The solution is to provide the immigrants/ refugees/ low-income families to spend as little money as possible on a product to minimize their spendings but also allow newcomers to know what to expect for a product to avoid paying more. 



# WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GO WITH THIS PROJECT?
We were motivated to do this product after experiencing friends from outside of the country come here and struggle with knowing where to buy products for a good price. Immigrants and refugees must adapt to a new country with new economic standards and costs of living. Those who donâ€™t realize the price they should be paying for a product may be at risk of spending more than they should. 


# HOW IMPACTFUL IS YOUR INNOVATION?
We hope to impact the lives of all immigrants/ refugees/ low-income families with our product




# WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPACT OF THE IDEA?
By providing a tool to low-income families/immigrants/refugees that effortlessly finds the best price of an item in the blink of an eye, we are ensuring that our most vulnerable communities have one less thing to worry about when it comes to financial responsibilities. We believe that people should not have to spend time and effort on trying to find the best price for an item, which is why our tool comes in handy. Right at your fingertips, you have the best price of an item within your area so you can shop worry-free and save every penny.
